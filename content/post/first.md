Everything has a beginning, weather we know it or not.  And this is my blog's beginning.  I hope to
write about things I work with, what I learn, what I get wrong, and more.  My current interests include
Authentication, Authorization, Big Data, Data Science, Security, Internet of Things, the Brain Project,
the intersection of Neurology and computers, politics - which I won't write about while I'm at Google,
sustainability, and much more.
